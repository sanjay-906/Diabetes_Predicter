MODEL ->  https://sanjay-906-diabetes-predictor-ui-99sdxz.streamlitapp.com/


NOTE:

Logistic Regression Algorithm is used to train the model
Model trained with a simple dataset
Model can predict wheather a person has diabetes/ has the chance of getting diabetes based on the input.
UI designed using streamlit module
Model deployed on Streamlit cloud
Model has approx 78% accuracy

INPUT CONTEXT:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)


----------------------------------------

Model expects input from a user who is 18 or older
